Background: Launch the ACS application and login the application ACS_GMR_Practice
     When I login with "ACS USER" user given in "Login" sheet ACS_GMR_Practice 

 @ACS_GMR_Practice
   #Scenario Outline: To verify user able to create Direct AWB ACS_GMR_Practice
   #Then To verify user able to create Direct AWB in FF login ACS_GMR_Practice "<MAWBNo_17>"
   #Then I login with "ACS AIRLINE KALE" user given in "Login" sheet ACS_GMR_Practice
   #Then To verify Airline login ACS_GMR_Practice "<MAWBNo_17>"
   #Then I login with "AADHYA USER" user given in "Login" sheet ACS_GMR_Practice
   #Then add 2SB details and generate single VT in CB login ACS_GMR_Practice
  # Examples:
   #|MAWBNo_17   |
   #|07072111    |
   
   #TC 13,26,27,29,48,50,54,55,56,61,63,65,67
   Scenario Outline: To verify user able to create consol AWB in FF login add 1SB ACS_GMR_Practice
  # Then I login with "ACS USER" user given in "Login" sheet ACS_GMR_Practice
   Then To verify user able to create consol AWB in FF login add 1SB ACS_GMR_Practice "<MAWBNo_13>"
   Then I login with "ACS AIRLINE KALE" user given in "Login" sheet ACS_GMR_Practice
   Then To verify airline login ACS_GMR_Practice "<MAWBNo_13>"
   Then I login with "AADHYA USER" user given in "Login" sheet ACS_GMR_Practice
   Then TSP process from airline login in CB login ACS_GMR_Practice "<MAWBNo_13>"
   Then To verify whether the user is able to delete SB details of existing SB before doing SB ASI from CB login ACS_GMR_Practice "<MAWBNo_13>"
   Then To verify whether the user is able to edit SB details of existing SB before doing SB ASI from CB login ACS_GMR_Practice "<MAWBNo_13>"
   Then To verify whether the user is able to delete SB details of existing SB after doing SB ASI from CB login ACS_GMR_Practice "<MAWBNo_13>"
   Then To verify whether the user is able to edit SB details of existing SB after doing SB ASI from CB login ACS_GMR_Practice "<MAWBNo_13>"
   Then To verify whether the system allow the user to do SB ASI for submitted SB ASI TSP done for 2 SB Addition of 3rd SB and Submission of SB ASI in CB login ACS_GMR_Practice "<MAWBNo_13>"
   Then To verify user able to create consol AWB in FF login add 1SB and generate multiple VT in CB login or not ACS_GMR_Practice "<MAWBNo_13>"
   Then To verify whether the user is able to view the TSP and VT Print as well as in CB login ACS_GMR_Practice "<MAWBNo_13>"
   Then VT print from CB login ACS_GMR_Practice "<MAWBNo_13>"
